# Daigdig
Daigdig is a universal healthcare app which seamlessly integrates various patient amenities by simplifying outpatient healthcare processes to help shatter barriers to healthcare utilization in the Philippines. It provides a single cohesive platform wherein all said procedures can be easily done on their mobile device, including doctor consultations (booking of appointments and teleconsulting), purchasing of prescription medications (via online shopping and cashless transactions), locating nearby open pharmacies, and procuring vital medical records and documents, all to be subject to informed consent from the patient. For further supplementation of digital healthcare delivery, Daigdig also promotes user health awareness in three ways: first, by providing a daily check-in test (for mental health monitoring purposes); second, by allowing easy tracking of oneâ€™s vital signs (obtained using a wearable); and third, by integrating a digital financial advisor inside the application.
